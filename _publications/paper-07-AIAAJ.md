collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-07-AIAAJ
excerpt: 'This work proposes an adjoint-free optimization method that has shown to be as good as adjoint-based optimization in the shape design of the Common Research Model wing. The proposed method addresses the curse of dimensionality in wing shape design optimization by using deep-learning techniques. First, a deep-learning-based optimal sampling method is developed to generate various wing shapes subject to both geometric validity and feasibility constraints. Then, a compact wing shape parameterization method is presented by deriving global wing mode shapes from the sample wings. The compact parameterization is embedded in an adjoint-free aircraft design framework -- pyAeroEGO. The results show that the proposed adjoint-free optimization method has almost the same efficiency and effectiveness as the adjoint-based optimization method in both single-point and multipoint design of the CRM wing.'
