My research is to improve the practicality of aerodynamic shape optimization in the industrial design of aircraft and wind energy systems. I aim to provide effective solutions to large-scale aerodynamic shape optimization problems, especially those with **massive design points**, **uncertain design variables**, **discontinuous merit functions**, and **multiple design objectives**. 

The difficulties to address the demands come from two fundamental issues: the high dimensionality of shape design variables and the high computational cost of CFD simulations. My research shows that using **scientific machine learning** is a way to solve these issues and realize practical and large-scale aerodynamic shape optimization for the industry. 

My research highlights are:

- Proposed a compact shape parameterization approach that addresses the dimensionality issue in design optimization of aircraft and wind turbines
- Developed fast aerodynamic models for on-design and off-design performance analysis to reduce the computational cost
- Presented a flexible and efficient optimization framework that enables effective aerodynamic shape optimization using any CFD solvers
