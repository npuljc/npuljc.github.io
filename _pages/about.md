I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at NUS with a general research topic on aerodynamic shape optimization and flow control.
I'm currently collaborating with T-lab@NUS on UAV design optimization.

My research aims to develop efficient and practical design optimization solutions for the industry.
This is being done by proposing:
* a compact parameterization methodology based on the modal reformulation of the high-dimensional feasible domain
* data-driven practical off-design constraints (for taking-off, buffet, etc.)
* a portable and efficient optimization framework
